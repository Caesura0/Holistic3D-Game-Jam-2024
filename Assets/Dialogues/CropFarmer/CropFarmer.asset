  - "Hey, you\u2019re the grandson everyone has been talking about, right? We have
    all been feeling so lost and bitter since The Factory has left us jobless and
    with all this mess to clean up. "
  - "I\u2019ve had such a hard time myself \u2013 I left my farm to work at The Factory
    and all my crops have died. I could really use a hand replanting some of these
    crops."
  - 'Do you think you could help me replant them while I look around in my shed for
    an axe for you to use? '
